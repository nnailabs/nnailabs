## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ I am currently an artificial intelligence engineer specializing in natural language processing and audio.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently researching frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformer, and algorithms like LLM, CNN, KNN, YOLO, and diffusion-based voice conversion.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am seeking collaborations to develop chatbot and callbot applications using LLM models such as Gemma and LLaMA, with the goal of building automated customer support systems.
- ðŸ’¬ If you are interested in discussing academic topics or the projects I am working on, please feel free to contact me â€” I am always open and willing to connect.

## Persional Project
### Chatbot RAG
- Development in 2025 at TQT GLOBAL TRADING CO., LTD
| Project name | Main tech | Describe |
| **Internal Chatbot for Business** |
- Model LLM: Gemma3 12b it.
- Server: vLLM.
- Type: RAG.
- Vector DB: ChromaDB.
- UI: Vercel ai-chatbot(Next.JS)  |
- An internal chatbot designed for document query tasks using Markdown files to answer questions related to internal documentation. It utilizes the Gemma 3 LLM and is implemented in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture, with the main inference server powered by vLLM. |
